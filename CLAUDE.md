# Breach Scan Funnel — Project Instructions

## HARD RULES — read before every response that involves code
**Never begin implementing a story unless explicitly asked in this session.**
**Read `docs/plan.md` in full before touching any code — it is the authoritative plan.**
**Backend is Python (FastAPI); map the global TS doctrine onto it, never swap the stack.**
**Strict TDD, no exceptions: no production line without a failing test first; every commit is
`test+impl`, `refactor`, or `chore` as defined in `docs/plan.md` → TDD contract. Untested code is a
defect, not a shortcut.**

## Project overview
Guardio take-home: mobile-first Breach Scan funnel on public HIBP data, a DB-backed **feature
flag** driving one A/B test on the result screen, stored funnel events, simulated traffic, and an
in-app statistical dashboard. Layout, data model, API contract and stories: `docs/plan.md`.

## What's done
(nothing yet — plan approved 2026-09-17)

## What's next
`/story-start S1` — scaffold (see `docs/plan.md` → E1 → S1).
